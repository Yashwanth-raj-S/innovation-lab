    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>In 1890s London, upcoming magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden become bitter rivals after Angier's wife dies during an onstage incident. Borden, who was responsible for tying the knots in the water tank trick, claims to not know which knot he tied, infuriating Angier. They go solo, and Angier re-hires the engineer, John Cutter, to help with his act. Meanwhile, Borden hires a previously unknown engineer called Bernard Fallon.

        While developing their own shows, Angier and Borden also take turns sabotaging each other. Angier loses his stage contract after Borden's distraction, while Borden loses two fingers when Angier becomes a volunteer for his bullet catch trick. Angier visits Borden's show again, but comes away surprised by Borden's debut of a new trick called the Transported Man, in which he appears to teleport. Angier is convinced the trick involves only one person, but recreates it for his act using a lookalike double, as suggested by Cutter. Despite his version being better received, Angier obsesses with Borden's secret. Borden exposes Angier's lookalike to the audience, further infuriating him.
        
        Following supposed clues from Borden's stolen diary, Angier arrives at Colorado Springs to meet the scientist Nikola Tesla, himself engaged in a bitter rivalry with scientist Thomas Edison. Tesla builds Angier a machine that creates a clone of its subject, but warns against its use. Nevertheless, Angier uses it for the Real Transported Man, a refined trick that brings him unprecedented recognition. Since Tesla's machine only 'clones' and does not 'transport' (as was originally intended), Angier replaces himself with a clone each night, sacrificing the original by dropping him in a water tank positioned below stage.
        
        Borden's wife Sarah commits suicide, which causes his mistress, Olivia, to leave him. Borden is left with a daughter, Jess. He sneaks under the stage at Angier's next show to learn his new secret, but is shocked to see Angier drown inside a water tank. Borden is arrested and put on trial for Angier's apparent murder. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Angier (who did not reappear that night purely to frame Borden) reverts back to his true identity as the aristocrat Lord Caldlow, to taunt Borden that he will adopt Jess. Borden gives up his secret at the prison, only to see his note torn up unread by Angier. Fallon is the last person to visit Borden at the prison, before he is taken to be executed.</p>
